# Steps to Set up Active Jobs on the Plugin Feeds

**Note:-** Node Uptime is of utmost importance when you have a live job.

## 🔗 GitHub Repository

This GitHub repository contains pre-defined job templates for various data feed pairs (e.g., ATOM/USDT, DOGE/USDT, CAKE/USDT).

Each folder includes job definitions using different price data sources - CoinMarketCap, Bitrue and CryptoCompare.

These definitions are designed to be directly used in the Plugin node, making it easier to set up and run live data feeds for your chosen crypto pair.

## 📌 Notes1: Create your own API key if required by the data source.

## 📌 Notes2: The node operators must maintain the minimum balance of 5 XDC.

## Setup Instructions

Set up a new job using the definition provided in the GitHub repository, specific to the price pair and data source assigned to you.

Navigate to the “Jobs” section.

Click on the ‘New Job’ button to add a job definition for each price pair.
