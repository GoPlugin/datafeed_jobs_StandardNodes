**Note:-** Node Uptime is of utmost importance when you have a live job.

## 🔗 GitHub Repository

[https://github.com/GoPlugin/datafeed_jobs_StandardNodes](https://github.com/GoPlugin/datafeed_jobs_StandardNodes)

This GitHub repository contains pre-defined job templates for various data feed pairs (e.g., ATOM/USDT, DOGE/USDT, CAKE/USDT).

Each folder includes job definitions using different price data sources - CoinMarketCap, Bitrue and CryptoCompare.

These definitions are designed to be directly used in the Plugin node, making it easier to set up and run live data feeds for your chosen crypto pair.

---

## Setup Instructions

Login in to your Plugin Node user interface.

Set up a new job using the definition provided in the GitHub repository, specific to the price pair and data source assigned to you.

Navigate to the “Jobs” section.

Click on the ‘New Job’ button to add a job definition for each price pair.

As mentioned above, in the GitHub repository, each folder contains job definitions with different sources. Copy the job definition that matches the price pair and source assigned to you.

Paste the job definition and click on the ‘Create New Job’ button.

## 📌 Notes: Create your own API key if required by the data source.
